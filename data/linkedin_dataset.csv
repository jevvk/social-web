They wanted a place with a casual atmosphere and a strong focus on quality food and service.

To differentiate themselves from other dining concepts, they decided an Australian theme fit the relaxed, friendly and fun image they wanted for their new restaurant. With a “No Rules, Just Right” mentality that takes food very seriously, but without taking themselves too seriously and operating under the premise that nothing stands in the way of pleasing the customer, they opened their first Outback Steakhouse restaurant in March 1988 in Tampa, Florida. Outback Steakhouse quickly became known as a place that served a great steak at a reasonable price by people who genuinely cared about the comfort, well-being and joy of their guests.

In 1916, General Pancho Villa’s revolution interrupted the bank’s role as banknote issuer for the Porfirio Diaz regime.
 
The bank was reorganized in 1926, becoming a financing bank and establishing the first agency of a Latin American bank in New York.
 
Banamex gradually introduced several financial product innovations to the Mexican market including savings accounts (in 1929), personal credit lines (in 1958), credit cards (in 1968), and ATM banking (in 1972).
In 1981, the California Commerce Bank was acquired by Banamex.
 
In 1997 Afore Banamex was created to tap into the newly created private pension fund market.
 
On August 6, 2001, Citigroup Inc. acquired Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival for US$12.5 billion, which became Grupo Financiero Banamex. This was the largest-ever U.S.-Mexico corporate merger. Grupo Financiero Banamex's operations were integrated with Citibank's relatively small existing Mexico business under the Banamex brand name.
 
On 2014, we celebrated our 130th anniversary, with a trajectory full of perseverance, dedication and pride.
 
Starting October 4th 2016, as part of the investment program to offer best client experience  -and as a further sign of Citi’s commitment to Mexico-, Banamex will be known as Citibanamex.

Everything starts with whole chickens that are slowly marinated in a special recipe of herbs, spices, fruit juices and garlic. The chicken is then expertly fire-grilled to perfection the authentic way - on our signature open-flame grills - then hand cut into your favorite Mexican entrees. We put that same dedication and care into our handmade guacamole, salsas and dressings every day.

We were founded by a scientist—not a corporate suit.

USANA’s founder, Myron Wentz, is an internationally recognized microbiologist, immunologist, and pioneer in infectious disease diagnosis. But success was never Dr. Wentz’ only aim. Instead, he centered his life around a dream of a world free from pain and suffering. A world free from disease. And he founded USANA to help further his dream by providing people all over the world with the most advanced supplements science can produce.

This is why USANA is a company based on continuous product innovation. This is why we have stringent manufacturing processes, ongoing scientific research, and an insatiable drive to produce exceptional products. This is why USANA is trusted by more than 1,000+ professional athletes and also everyday people who believe health is a vital part of a long, happy life.

Our goal is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel anti-infective products. 

Nabriva was incorporated as a spin-off from Sandoz GmbH Antibiotics Research Institute (ABRI) in Vienna, Austria and commenced operations in February 2006. The new organization included small molecule assets, including pleuromutilin structure activity relationships (SAR) knowledge and was focused on synthesis of pleuromutilins for systemic human use.  Following identification of our lead compound lefamulin and based on the clinical results of lefamulin for Acute Skin and Skin Structure Infections.  We believed that targeted in vitro spectrum of activity for the common pathogens causing Community Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP), would allow us to develop lefamulin as the first pleuromutilin IV and oral antibiotic for human systemic administration for CABP.   

In 2014, we opened our US office in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and completed an IPO on the NASDAQ under the ticker NBRV in September 2015. With net proceeds from our IPO, we initiated two global, registrational Phase 3 clinical trials of lefamulin for the treatment of moderate to severe CABP. 

Based on our estimates regarding patient enrollment, we expect to have top-line data available for both trials in the second half of 2017. If the results of these trials are favorable, including achievement of the primary efficacy endpoints of the trials, we expect to submit applications for marketing approval for lefamulin for the treatment of CABP in both the United States and Europe in 2018. 

As of April 1, 2016, Nabriva employed 52 employees at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, and its office in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, United States.",,,,

To be America’s neighborhood hardware and garden store focused on paint, repair, and the backyard.

Our Story

1931 was a year of hard times for farmers in San José, California. Two years of drought and crop failures plus the Great Depression brought plenty of economic woe. Thirty farmers, mostly prune growers, considered buying their farm supplies as a cooperative. Each farmer put up $30 and Orchard Supply was born.

Business grew and Orchard Supply moved to a larger location on 44 Vine Street. In addition to farm supplies, the new store location brought in hardware, gardening supplies, housewares and homewares. Again, business flourished and in 1946, a new store was built at 720 West San Carlos Street. The newest location featured a rail-served warehouse and 26,000 square feet of retail space. By this time the purchasing cooperative had almost 2,000 members and Orchard Supply was recognized as a leading hardware store in San José.

In 1962, Albert B. Smith became president of Orchard Supply Hardware. Under his direction Orchard Supply Hardware grew with branch stores being established throughout the county. In 1973, the Capitola store became the first out-of-county location. In the mid 1970's, a nineteen acre warehouse and office complex in San José was purchased from Sunsweet Growers to serve as a distribution center for all Orchard stores. Fondly called the "Prune Palace," it served Orchard Supply Hardware well up to 1992, when a new distribution center was opened in the central California community of Tracy.

The concepts that made Orchard Supply Hardware a successful hardware retailer continue. With over 45,000 items, modern, easy-to-shop stores and acclaimed customer service, Orchard Supply Hardware maintains the same simple retail philosophy developed long ago, "Take good care of our customers and they will take good care of you."",,,,

In recent years, we've accelerated our number of store openings across the UK and Ireland, with a new store planned for Germany in 2015. We have also opened a brand new format: schuh kids, which offers the same shoes and the same great service but for smaller feet.

 - Maintaining a balanced portfolio of high-quality assets with superior growth prospects in markets that have high barriers to entry.
 - Employing disciplined and innovative approaches to asset management that drive meaningful upside to underlying performance.
 -  Preserving a clean, conservative balance sheet that supports strategic and financial flexibility, dividends and shareholder returns.

Headquartered in Sacramento, California, GenCorp's businesses include Aerojet Rocketdyne and Real Estate at facilities across the United States and in Europe.

In business for a century, the combined companies of GenCorp provide over 130 years of experience, know-how, professionalism, and quality work, all at competitive prices meeting budgets and deadlines.  GenCorp offers what no other company can - bringing decades of history that launched the first space age and now puts mission-critical technology into the hands of our warfighters.

GenCorp was established in 1915, originally as the General Tire & Rubber Company. The name change to GenCorp was implemented in 1984 when the company was formed as a parent holding company. In a subsequent restructuring, the company exited the tire business by divesting General Tire. In 1999, GenCorp spun off its Decorative & Building Products and Performance Chemicals businesses into a separate, publicly-traded company called OMNOVA Solutions, Inc. Most recently, Rocketdyne became a part of GenCorp.

GenCorp President and CEO Scott Seymour puts it all into perspective this way, "Our vision for the future is a shared one. We have the best workforce in the industry and we are committed to 100% safety and mission success as we continue to deliver performance, drive innovation and create opportunity. We are continuing our already impressive legacy to be a leader in the next space age."",,,,

A remarkable difference you can see and feel.
It takes a skilled plastic surgeon to create the perfect look. But only your implant can create the right feel.

At Sientra, we understand dedication. That's why we cater exclusively to board-certified plastic surgeons. As you deliver on the high expectations of your patients each day, we'll be doing the same for you with innovative products and unsurpassed service.

At Sientra, we offer both round and shaped (teardrop) implant options. Each utilizes a proprietary gel fill technology, High-Strength Cohesive (HSC) Silicone Gel, with a formulation unique to each implant shape.

HSC round implants are the right choice for a fuller appearance and more dramatic cleavage. Our HSC+ shaped implants, with a more cohesive gel fill, are designed to create a more contoured, natural silhouette. Each style combines our exclusive HSC Silicone Gel interior with a durable outer shell to create a soft, natural-like feel without sacrificing the integrity of the implant.

One shape does not fit all. That’s why both HSC round and HSC+ shaped implants are available in different shapes and sizes so that you and your board-certified plastic surgeon can create the look that’s right for you.

The gel used as the implant filler material in Sientra’s HSC and HSC+ implants have undergone thorough testing. In rigorous laboratory tests that push breast implants to their limits, Sientra's two gels were demonstrated to be the strongest available on the market, while the complete implants (gel and shell together) remain remarkably soft to the touch.

At Sientra, we believe that shared expertise and values are essential components of success. Our leadership is driven by decades of experience and skill that help bring your goals and aesthetic visions to life.

From 1960–1990, taste buds across the southeastern and southwestern U.S. were able to experience first–hand the made–from–scratch crispy, crackery Original Thin crust, and tangy signature sauce that are still hallmarks of the Pizza Inn brand today.

Throughout its 60-year history, Pizza Inn has prided itself on freshness and innovation, introducing the Taco Pizza in 1979, the first dessert “pizzert” pizza in 1986 and the chain’s hallmark bacon cheeseburger pizza by the 1990s.

In 1994, Pizza Inn was named the #1 Pizza Chain in the U.S. by Restaurants and Institutions magazines annual “America's Choice in Chains” consumer poll.  And today, Pizza Inn, headquartered in the Dallas area, operates more than 310 restaurants domestically and internationally, with several new stores scheduled to open in the next year.

2020b is a "breakthrough accelerator" that solves five major problems with breakthrough solutions that dramatically improve real estate development, schools in America, clean energy production, charitable giving, and online networking. 

Living

Despite billions of dollars in urban investment, our cities still aren’t livable.  There is a huge demand for the urban lifestyle, but due to increasingly high development costs, most can’t afford it.  2020b has the solution.  Our buildings are the same luxury and the same quality, produced for half the price in half the time.  This is, truly, an industry transformation.

Learning

America’s schools are outdated and unacceptable.  Our students deserve the highest quality schools, and 2020b has the solution.  These state-of-the-art facilities feature the best technology and most refined learning environments – all for half the price.  And best of all, they can be paid for with their energy savings, not more government funding.

Life

Today's wind, solar, and other renewable technologies are too expensive to be a true alternative.  At best, they’re just a supplement.  2020b has the solution.  This breakthrough technology can solve America's energy needs and cut green house gas emissions dramatically and affordably.  And the price of this new energy is less than coal, natural gas, and nuclear.  The industry missed something – something big.  We found it.",,,,

More than 2,400 treatments have been administered to date using our EyeGate® II Delivery System in clinical trials.

About AlloSure®

AlloSure is the first and only noninvasive blood test that directly measures allograft injury and identifies the probability of active rejection to better manage kidney transplant patients. AlloSure is a clinical-grade, proprietary Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) based test to detect donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) in order to identify organ injury in kidney transplant recipients. AlloSure is analytically validated as a sensitive, specific, and precise measurement of dd-cfDNA. AlloSure detects active rejection (acute active ABMR, chronic active ABMR, or TCMR) with high accuracy, outperforms serum creatinine in kidney transplant recipients, and is highly sensitive in distinguishing ABMR from no ABMR. AlloSure is performed in the CareDx CLIA-certified laboratory.

About AlloMap® 

AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing is a non-invasive blood test used to aid in the identification of heart transplant recipients with stable allograft function who have a low probability of moderate/severe acute cellular rejection at the time of testing in conjunction with standard clinical assessment. AlloMap testing measures the expression levels of 20 genes from a blood sample. The combined expression of these genes is represented as an AlloMap test score. AlloMap is performed in the CareDx CLIA-certified laboratory and has been commercially available in the United States since 2005. AlloMap was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2008 and was CE marked for the European Union in 2011. Use of AlloMap is also included in the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Practice Guidelines, published in August 2010, the worldwide standard for the care of heart transplant patients.

The products release an advanced steroid with anti-inflammatory properties directly into the sinus lining, then dissolve, maintaining the open passages created in ethmoid sinus surgery.

In addition, Intersect ENT is pursuing clinical trials designed to support expanded indications and to assess two new investigational drug-eluting implants to provide ENT physicians with additional options to treat patients with chronic sinusitis less invasively and more cost effectively.
